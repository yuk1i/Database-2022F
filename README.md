### Interface Specification

The structure of the interfaces is as follows.

- `database` folder stores connection information such as username, password, url, we only provides `PostgreSQL` as the DBMS.
- `dto` folder stores a set of data objects that will be accessed by interfaces. Your implementation will use them as
  parameters or returned values.
- `service` folder stores **Service Interfaces**, this is the folder you should pay special attention to. There exist
  multiple `.java` file where the interface signatures are stored. You need to implement you own `class` to fit these
  signatures.
- `exception` folder stores exceptions that you should `throw` if something went wrong.
- `factory` folder stores the `ServiceFactory` abstract class that you need to implement to create your service
  instances.

### Your Tasks

- Design your PostgreSQL database.
- Implement the `service` and `factory` interfaces to pass the base testcases.
- Profile your implementation and find ways to speed it up.

Please check out [project_guide.md](project_guide.md) for initial guidance.

### Requirements of interface

- All `add*()` functions with int as return value should return the (presumably auto-generated) ID.
- All arguments are guaranteed to be non-null, unless marked as @Nullable.
- All return values (and their fields) should be non-null, unless explicitly documented otherwise. If a list/map is
  empty, put List.of()/Map.of() or equivalents instead of null.
- Do **NOT** modify anything in the provided interfaces, or any of the framework code.
- Your implementation should throw `java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException` if a method is not actually implemented,
  so the tests can fail quickly.


### Rules

- Data should be persisted on disk after each write operation instead of only modified in RAM. If you introduced a cache
  layer, you have to enforce the consistency. You should also ensure the durability in case of a sudden shutdown.
- You should **NOT** use frameworks such as **ORM**.
- You don't need to spend time on **GUI/WEB**, as we do **NOT** give extra scores for them.

#### Java-specific rules

- Your package should **NOT** start with `cn.`, i.e., your package shouldn't locate in `src/main/java/cn/` folder or its
  subfolder.
- You are free to modify any classes under package `cn.edu.sustech.cs307` for debugging.
  But we will reset `src/main/java/cn/` folder in your submission to this version. So after resetting
  the `cn.edu.sustech.cs307` package, your implementation should still work fine.

  For example:
  - You can override `toString` method for classes in `cn.edu.sustech.cs307.dto`.
  - You can modify the judge program `cn.edu.sustech.cs307.util.ProjectJudge` to print your wrong cases.
  - You can not modify constructors for `cn.edu.sustech.cs307.dto`.
- You should **NOT** extend any class in package `cn.edu.sustech.cs307.dto`.
- In this project, we use Maven to manage dependent libraries. If you want to introduce a new library, you need to
  record it in `pom.xml`. Your dependencies should be downloadable from the Maven Central repository.

## 2. What to deliver?

- **PASS BASE TEST:** First and foremost, you should pass the base testcases, this is the basic requirement.

- **IMPROVE YOUR EFFICIENCY:** After you passed the base tests, you need to find ways to improve the performance of your implementation. You can work on the following aspects.

    #### Resource Consumption

    - Memory Consumption: How much memory your database takes?
    - Disk Consumption: How much disk space your database takes? How are they distributed? (index, data, other info?)

    #### Speed

    - Data Import Speed: How much time your database need to import all data?
    - Data Modify Speed (Insertion, Update, Deletion): How much time your database need to change one/one hundred/one million rows?
    - Data Query Speed: How much time your database need to fetch one/one hundred/one million rows?
    - Cache Policy: How much time your database need to fetch a row if the row was just accessed by others?

    #### Concurrency

    - Simultaneous Query Number: How many queries can your database handles simultaneously?
    - Simultaneous Query Latency: How long does it take to query if there are many users connect to your database simultaneously.
    - Transaction Safety: Is your database safe with many users concurrently writing/reading to it?

    #### Correctness

    - Malformed Data Identification: Can your database identify the malformed data automatically?
    - ACID Principle


- **(Optional) DIFFERENT WAYS SAME GOAL?** Can you find other ways to implement these functionalities? Are they **BETTER/WORSE/USECASE-RELATED?** Please do share us your amazing ideas.
